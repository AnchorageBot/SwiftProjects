Neuroevolution is a method for optimizing neural network weights and topologies using evolutionary computation.

NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) is a method for evolving speciated neural networks of arbitrary structures and sizes. NEAT leverages the evolution of structure to make neuroevolution more efficient.
