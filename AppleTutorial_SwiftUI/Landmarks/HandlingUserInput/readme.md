[Handling User Input](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui/handling-user-input)

In the Landmarks app, a user can flag their favorite places, and filter the list to show just their favorites. To create this
feature, you’ll start by adding a switch to the list so users can focus on just their favorites, and then you’ll add a 
star-shaped button that a user taps to flag a landmark as a favorite.

Project Phases
* Mark the User's Landmarks
* Filter the List View
* Add a Control to Toggle the State
* Use an Observable Object for Storage
* Adopt the Model Object in Your Views
* Create a Favorite Button for Each Landmark
