Creating and Combining Views

You’ll start by building the view that shows a landmark’s details. To lay out the views, Landmarks uses stacks to combine
and layer the image and text view components. To add a map to the view, you’ll include a standard MapKit component. 
As you refine the view’s design, Xcode provides real-time feedback so you can see how those changes translate into code.
