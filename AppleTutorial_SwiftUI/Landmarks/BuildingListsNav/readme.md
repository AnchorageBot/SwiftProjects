2nd Draft

With the basic landmark detail view set up, you need to provide a way for users to see the full list of landmarks, and to view the details about each location.

You’ll create views that can show information about any landmark, and dynamically generate a scrolling list that a user can tap to see a detail view for a landmark.
To fine-tune the UI, you’ll use Xcode’s canvas to render multiple previews at different device sizes.
