[Interfacing with UIKit](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui/interfacing-with-uikit#introduction)

SwiftUI works seamlessly with the existing UI frameworks on all Apple platforms. For example, you can place UIKit views and view controllers inside SwiftUI views, and vice versa.

This tutorial shows you how to convert the featured landmark from the home screen to wrap instances of UIPageViewController and UIPageControl. You’ll use UIPageViewController to display a carousel of SwiftUI views, and use state variables and bindings to coordinate data updates throughout the user interface.

Project Phases
* Create a View to Represent a UIPageViewController
* Create the View Controller’s Data Source
* Track the Page in a SwiftUI View’s State
* Add a Custom Page Control
