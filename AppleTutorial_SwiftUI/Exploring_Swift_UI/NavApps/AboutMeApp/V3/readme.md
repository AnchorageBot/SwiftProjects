3rd Draft

Made with Playgrounds 4.3.1

How to create this with Playground commands:
* Open Playgrounds
* Select the App option (bottom left of screen)
* Right click and rename the resulting App
* Double click the renamed App to open it

Underneath the 'Code' heading (on the upper left of the screen) are two autogenerated files:
* ContentView.swift
* MyApp.swift

Create additional files via keyboard command:
* Command (Splat) N autogenerates: 
* NewFile.swift

Edit existing files and create additional new ones until the app works
