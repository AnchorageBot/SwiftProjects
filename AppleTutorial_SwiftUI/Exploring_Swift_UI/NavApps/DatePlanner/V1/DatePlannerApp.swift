 How the app shares data with its views by creating a single data object and
 making it available to the entire view hierachy

*/

import SwiftUI

struct DatePlannerApp: App {

    // A property wrapper type that instantiates an observable object
    // Use a state object as the single source of truth for a reference type that you store in a view hierarchy
    @StateObject private var eventData = EventData()

    var body: some Scene {

        // A scene that presents a group of identically structured windows
        WindowGroup {

            // A view for presenting a stack of views that represents a visible path in a navigation hierarchy
            // Depreciated
            NavigationView {

                EventList()

                Text("Select an Event")
                    .foregroundStyle(.secondary)
            }
            // Supplies an observable object to a viewâ€™s hierarchy
            .environmentObject(eventData)

        }
    }
