Choose Your Own Story

Provide dynamic navigation between views.

In this sample, you can write a story with many different paths and outcomes. 
Your reader can make choices at important points in the narrative, resulting in different 
experiences based on their responses.

There are several parts to this app. StoryData contains the story itself, including the text
on each page and the choices the reader can make.

StoryView sets up the navigation for the app, and StoryPageView displays the contents of one page of the story.

You can start in StoryData and write your own narrative, or you can learn about and modify the look and feel
of the app in StoryView and StoryPageView.
