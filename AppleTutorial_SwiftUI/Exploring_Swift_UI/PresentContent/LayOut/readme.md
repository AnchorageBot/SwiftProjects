[Laying Out Views](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/sample-apps/layingoutviews)

Organize, size and align view layouts.

When creating an app, one of the first skills to learn is how to lay out your user interface, or UI. When laying out a UI, there are three major things you need to do:
* Organize your views in different configurations using container views.
* Fine tune the sizing, spacing, alignment, and positioning of your views.
* Debug your views when something goes wrong.
