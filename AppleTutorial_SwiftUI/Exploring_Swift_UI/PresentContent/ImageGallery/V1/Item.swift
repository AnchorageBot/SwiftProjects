 Models a grid itemâ€™s data and adds Identifiable conformance

*/

import SwiftUI


/*

 When you use ForEach to construct a collection view, such as a list or grid, SwiftUI wants to uniquely identify each view
 so it can find and update them. To make this easier, you can create a model that conforms to Identifiable, which creates an
 id property requirement.

 */

struct Item: Identifiable {

    // id property that SwiftUI uses to uniquely identify the view
    let id = UUID()

    // url property that the app uses to identify the location of the corresponding image using a path to the file
    let url: URL

    static func ==(lhs: Item, rhs: Item) -> Bool {
        return lhs.id == rhs.id && lhs.id == rhs.id
