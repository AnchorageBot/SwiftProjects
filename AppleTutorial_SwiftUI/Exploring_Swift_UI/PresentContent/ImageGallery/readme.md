[Image Gallery](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/sample-apps/imagegallery)

Retrieve and display images from an asset catalog or a photo library.

Welcome to the Image Gallery app. This walkthrough shows how to create a grid of images, complete with photo-picking and -editing functionality.

This sample is an extension of two simpler implementations: Organizing with Grids and Editing Grids. This walkthrough focuses on solving some common issues after your grid displays images, instead of shapes or SF Symbols.

Larger images can load slowly, which can cause noticeable delays when loading your appâ€™s UI. This sample focuses on unblocking delays by showing progress indicators until each image loads and keeping your app responsive during the loading process.
