[addItem(_:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsmenu/1518176-additem)
* Adds a menu item to the end of the menu

[App](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/App)
* A type that represents the structure and behavior of an app

[Array](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/array)
* An ordered, random-access collection

[AsyncImage](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/asyncimage)
* A view that asynchronously loads and displays an image

[Binding](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/binding)
* A property wrapper type that can read and write a value owned by a source of truth

[Body](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/App/body-swift.property)
* The content and behavior of the app

[Classes and Structures](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/choosing-between-structures-and-classes)
* Decide how to store data and model behavior

[Content View](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uitableviewcell/1623229-contentview)
* The content view of the cell object

[Control Flow](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/controlflow)
* Structure code with branches, loops, and early exits

[Declarations](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/declarations)
* Introduce types, operators, variables, and other names and constructs

[Environment](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/environment)
* A property wrapper that reads a value from a view’s environment

[Enumerations and Structures](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/guidedtour#Enumerations-and-Structures)
* Like classes and all other named types, enumerations can have methods associated with them
* Structures support many of the same behaviors as classes, including methods and initializers. One of the most important differences between structures and classes is that structures are always copied when they’re passed around in your code, but classes are passed by reference.

[Error Handling](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/guidedtour#Error-Handling)
* There are several ways to handle errors

[FileManager](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/filemanager)
* A convenient interface to the contents of the file system, and the primary means of interacting with it

[GridItem](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/griditem)
* A description of a row or a column in a lazy grid

[Identifiable](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/Identifiable)
* A class of types whose instances hold the value of an entity with stable identity

[Image](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/image)
* A view that displays an image

[Import Declaration](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/declarations/#Import-Declaration)
* An import declaration lets you access symbols that are declared outside the current file. The basic form imports the entire module; it consists of the import keyword followed by a module name:

[LazyVGrid](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/LazyVGrid)
* A container view that arranges its child views in a grid that grows vertically, creating items only as needed

[NavigationStack](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/navigationstack)
* A view that displays a root view and enables you to present additional views over the root view

[ObservableObject](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/observableobject)
* A type of object with a publisher that emits before the object has changed

[Preview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/previews-in-xcode)
* Generate dynamic, interactive previews of your custom views

[Scene](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/scene)
* A part of an app’s user interface with a life cycle managed by the system

[ScrollView](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/ScrollView)
* A scrollable view

[State](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/state)
* A property wrapper type that can read and write a value managed by SwiftUI

[Statements](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/statements)
* In Swift, there are three kinds of statements: simple statements, compiler control statements, and control flow statements

[Structures and Classes](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/classesandstructures)
* Model custom types that encapsulate data

[Symbols](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/symbols)
* Apply universal animations to symbol-based images

[TabView](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/tabview)
* A view that switches between multiple child views using interactive user interface elements

[Types](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/types)
* In Swift, there are two kinds of types: named types and compound types

[URL](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/url)
* A value that identifies the location of a resource, such as an item on a remote server or the path to a local file

[View](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view)
* A type that represents part of your app’s user interface and provides modifiers that you use to configure views

[VStack](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/vstack/)
* A view that arranges its subviews in a vertical line

[WindowGroup](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/WindowGroup)
* A scene that presents a group of identically structured windows
