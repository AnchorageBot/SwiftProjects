[App](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/App)
* A type that represents the structure and behavior of an app

[Binding](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/binding)
* A property wrapper type that can read and write a value owned by a source of truth

[Body](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/App/body-swift.property)
* The content and behavior of the app

[Content View](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uitableviewcell/1623229-contentview)
* The content view of the cell object

[Declarations](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/declarations)
* Introduce types, operators, variables, and other names and constructs

[Environment](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/environment)
* A property wrapper that reads a value from a view’s environment

[Enumerations and Structures](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/guidedtour#Enumerations-and-Structures)
* Like classes and all other named types, enumerations can have methods associated with them
* Structures support many of the same behaviors as classes, including methods and initializers. One of the most important differences between structures and classes is that structures are always copied when they’re passed around in your code, but classes are passed by reference.

[Error Handling](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/guidedtour#Error-Handling)
* There are several ways to handle errors

[Image](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/image)
* A view that displays an image

[Import Declaration](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/declarations/#Import-Declaration)
* An import declaration lets you access symbols that are declared outside the current file. The basic form imports the entire module; it consists of the import keyword followed by a module name:

[LazyVGrid](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/LazyVGrid)
* A container view that arranges its child views in a grid that grows vertically, creating items only as needed

[Preview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/previews-in-xcode)
* Generate dynamic, interactive previews of your custom views

[Scene](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/scene)
* A part of an app’s user interface with a life cycle managed by the system

[ScrollView](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/ScrollView)
* A scrollable view

[State](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/state)
* A property wrapper type that can read and write a value managed by SwiftUI

[Statements](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/statements)
* In Swift, there are three kinds of statements: simple statements, compiler control statements, and control flow statements

[Symbols](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/symbols)
* Apply universal animations to symbol-based images

[Types](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/types)
* In Swift, there are two kinds of types: named types and compound types

[View](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view)
* A type that represents part of your app’s user interface and provides modifiers that you use to configure views

[VStack](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/vstack/)
* A view that arranges its subviews in a vertical line

[WindowGroup](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/WindowGroup)
* A scene that presents a group of identically structured windows
