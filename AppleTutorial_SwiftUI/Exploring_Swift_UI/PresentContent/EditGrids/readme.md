[Editing Grids](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/sample-apps/editinggrids)

Let people edit data that your app displays.

In Organizing with Grids, you learned how to lay out your app’s interface using a grid of colored rectangles. In this sample, you’ll create a similar grid interface populated with SF Symbols. 

To build on what you’ve learned, Editing Grids takes your app to the next level by teaching you about two important features in app design: navigating within your app, and making it possible for people to edit data that they store in the app.
To make it easy for people to move around in your app, you need to provide a way for them to navigate between different views. For Editing Grids, you’ll configure the app so people can tap a symbol in the grid to switch views.
Another feature is an editing mode, allowing you to edit the data in your app. Here you’ll learn how to add editing functionality to a grid, including adding and removing grid items.
