[Specifying the view hierarchy of an app using a scene](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui-concepts/specifying-the-view-hierarchy-of-an-app-using-a-scene)

A scene contains the view hierarchy of your app.

SwiftUI provides building blocks that help you create the user interface of your app. One of those building blocks is Scene,
which contains a view hierarchy that defines the user interface of your app. You can specify your appâ€™s view hierarchy
in a scene that SwiftUI provides, or you can create a custom scene. This tutorial walks you through both approaches.
