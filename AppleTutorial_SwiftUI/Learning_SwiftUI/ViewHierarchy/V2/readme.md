How to create this project with Xcode commands:
 Xcode->File->New Project -> iOS - App
 * This creates two files
   * ContentView.swift
   * LearnSwiftUIApp.swift

Main Folder (Added via Xcode -> File -> New -> Group) holds two files (just drag and drop the files into this folder)
* ContentView.swift
* LearnSwiftUIApp.swift

View Folder (Added via Xcode -> File -> New -> Group) holds three files (just drag and drop the files into this folder)
* AppSettingsView.swift (this is not in the tutorial, however it was created since it is referenced in the LearnSwiftUIApp.swift file)
* JournalView.swift (this is not in the tutorial, however it was created since it is referenced in the LearnSwiftUIApp.swift file)
* macOSView.swift (this is not in the tutorial, however it was created since it is referenced in the macOS_Scenes.swift file)

Scene Folder (Added via Xcode -> File -> New -> Group) holds two files (just drag and drop the files into this folder)
