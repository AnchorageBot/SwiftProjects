Design a custom control

Before implementing a custom control, ask yourself what data does the control need, what does it do with that data, and how it does it represent that data visually within the app. The sample app, for instance, needs an Int property that represents the rating of a recipe. The control needs to be able to change the value of this property. And because the control shows the rating of a recipe, it needs to display a set of stars that reflects the rating value; for instance, the control displays five stars when the rating value is 5.
