[Creating a custom input control that binds to a value](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui-concepts/creating-a-custom-input-control-that-binds-to-a-value)

Provide interactions that are unique to your app with custom controls that bind to a value.

SwiftUI provides input controls like Slider, TextField, and many others that bind to a value and can change the value as a personâ€™s 
interacts with the control. But every app is different. You may find that you need a custom control that provides behavior unique to 
your app.

SwiftUI provides the building blocks you need to create a custom input control for your app. This tutorial walks through an example
of one such control, a rating control. The sample app uses this control to let people rate recipes from 1 to 5 stars.
