View layout

[Scaling views to complement text](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui-concepts/scaling-views-to-complement-text)

Construct a layout that adapts to font styles, Dynamic Type, and varying string lengths.

When composing a view that includes text, it’s important to define other elements relative to that text, like a symbol or padding, so the view adapts to the text’s size.

The symbol and padding can adapt as the text content changes for localizations, Dynamic Type sizes, or to display a different phrase.
