[Adjusting the space between views](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui-concepts/adjusting-the-space-between-views)

Specify the alignment and spacing of your content.

As you define the views that display information, you can adjust the layout by declaring where any extra space should go. Depending on how
you want your layout to adapt, you may choose different tools. Some of the tools for managing the space between views are themselves views,
like Spacer. There are also view modifiers that affect the space adjacent to a view, like padding(_:_:). In some cases, you affect a layout
by providing a non-default value as a parameter of a view or modifier.
