This draft uses two folders to organize the individual app files

* Main
  * LearnSwiftUI_V5.swift (the uber grunt)
  * ContentView.swift (the one view that controls all the views)
  * TrainCar.swift (data rich file which all files in the view folder reference)
* Views
  * Train_Cars.swift
  * DefaultSpacing.swift
  * SpecificSpacing.swift
  * ScaledSpacing.swift
  * ZeroSpacing.swift
  * DefaultPadding.swift
  * PaddingSomeEdges.swift
  * SpecificPadding.swift
  * PaddingContainer.swift
