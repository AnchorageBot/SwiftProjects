Refactored app with a button 

- - - -

Claude:

This revised code demonstrates a more modern and concise way of creating and configuring a button in Swift using Auto Layout.

By using Auto Layout and constraints, the button is positioned and sized relative to the view controller's view. This approach is more flexible and adaptable to different screen sizes and orientations.

The SecondVC class is also simplified by removing the MyView property, as it's not necessary for the purpose of this example.

With these changes, the user can navigate from the button screen to the red screen by tapping the "Tap Me" button, and then return to the button screen by tapping the "Go Back" button on the red screen.
This example demonstrates a simple navigation flow between two view controllers using buttons and the present(_:animated:) and dismiss(animated:) methods.
