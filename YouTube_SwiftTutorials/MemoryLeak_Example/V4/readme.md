Refactored app with a button 

- - - -

Claude:

This revised code demonstrates a more modern and concise way of creating and configuring a button in Swift using Auto Layout.

By using Auto Layout and constraints, the button is positioned and sized relative to the view controller's view. This approach is more flexible and adaptable to different screen sizes and orientations.

The SecondVC class is also simplified by removing the MyView property, as it's not necessary for the purpose of this example.
