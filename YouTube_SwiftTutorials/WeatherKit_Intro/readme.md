How to employ WeatherKit in a App:

* Ensure that you have an active Apple Developer Program membership, as it is required to use WeatherKit.
* Open your project in Xcode.
* Select your project at the top of the project navigator (the blue icon with your project's name).
* Go to the "Signing & Capabilities" tab.
* Click on the "+" button and add the "WeatherKit" capability. This will automatically add the necessary frameworks and entitlements to your project.
* Ensure that your project is using the correct provisioning profile that includes the WeatherKit entitlement:

* Go to the Apple Developer portal (https://developer.apple.com/).
* Navigate to the "Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles" section.
* Select "Profiles" from the left sidebar.
* Locate the provisioning profile associated with your project.
* If needed, create a new provisioning profile or update an existing one to include the WeatherKit entitlement.
* Download the updated provisioning profile and double-click it to install in Xcode.
* Clean and build your project to ensure that the changes take effect.
