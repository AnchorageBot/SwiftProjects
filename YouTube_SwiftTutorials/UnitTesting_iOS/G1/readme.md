- **SwiftUI**: Apple's declarative framework for building user interfaces across all Apple platforms.

## SwiftData
- **SwiftData**: Apple's framework for data modeling and persistence.
- **@Model**: A property wrapper used to define a class as a SwiftData model.
- **@Query**: A property wrapper used to fetch data from SwiftData.
- **@Environment(\.modelContext)**: A property wrapper to access the SwiftData model context.

## Swift Property Wrappers
- **@State**: A property wrapper for storing mutable state in a view.
- **@Binding**: A property wrapper for creating a two-way connection between a property and the underlying storage.

## Mathematical Concepts
- **Odd Number**: An integer that is not divisible by 2 without a remainder.
- **Even Number**: An integer that is divisible by 2 without a remainder.
- **Prime Number**: A natural number greater than 1 that is only divisible by 1 and itself.
- **Factorial**: The product of all positive integers less than or equal to a given number.

## SwiftUI Views and Modifiers
- **NavigationView**: A view that manages a stack of views in a navigation hierarchy.
- **Form**: A container for grouping controls used for data entry.
- **Section**: A container for grouping related controls within a form or list.
- **TextField**: A control that displays an editable text interface.
- **Button**: A control that initiates an action when triggered.
- **List**: A container that presents rows of data arranged in a single column.
- **ForEach**: A structure that computes views on demand from an underlying collection of identified data.
- **onDelete**: A modifier that adds support for delete operations in a list.

## Swift Standard Library
- **Int**: A signed integer value type.
- **Double**: A double-precision, floating-point value type.
- **String**: A Unicode string value type.
- **Date**: A value type that represents a point in time.
- **Array**: A collection that stores values of the same type in an ordered list.

## Xcode and Development
- **Xcode**: The integrated development environment (IDE) used for building the app.

- **Build**: The process of compiling and linking the app's source code.

## Version Control
- **GitHub**: A platform for version control and collaboration.

## App-Specific Terms
- **NumberListItem**: A custom class representing a pair of numbers and their properties in the app.
- **BasicMathAppV2**: The main app structure for version 2 of the BasicMath app.
- **ContentView**: The main view of the BasicMath app that handles user input and displays results.
