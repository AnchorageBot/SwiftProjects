Let's go through it step by step:

```swift
public static func isPrime(_ number: Int) -> Bool {
```
This line declares a public static function named `isPrime`. It takes one parameter `number` of type `Int` and returns a `Bool` value.

```swift
guard number > 1 else { return false }
```
This is a guard statement that immediately returns `false` if the input number is less than or equal to 1. This is because prime numbers are defined as natural numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves.

```swift
for i in 2..<Int(Double(number).squareRoot()) + 1 {
```
This line starts a for loop that iterates from 2 up to the square root of the input number. We only need to check up to the square root because if a number is divisible by something larger than its square root, it would also be divisible by something smaller than its square root.

The `Double(number).squareRoot()` calculates the square root of the number (after converting it to a Double for precision), and then we convert it back to an Int and add 1 to ensure we include the square root in our check if it's a whole number.

```swift
if number % i == 0 {
    return false
}
```
Inside the loop, we check if the number is divisible by the current value of `i`. If it is (i.e., if the remainder of the division is 0), we immediately return `false` because we've found a divisor other than 1 and the number itself.

```swift
return true
```
If we've made it through the entire loop without finding any divisors, we return `true`, indicating that the number is prime.

This implementation is an optimized version of the prime-checking algorithm. By only checking up to the square root of the number, it significantly reduces the number of iterations required for large numbers, making it more efficient than checking all numbers up to `number - 1`.
