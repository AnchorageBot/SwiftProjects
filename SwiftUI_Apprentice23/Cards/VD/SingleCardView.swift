// Abstract:  This SwiftUI application serves as a foundation for a card-based information display system. It currently implements a scrollable list of card thumbnails with full-screen detail views. Future development will include features such as [mention planned features, e.g., data loading from a remote source, user interaction with card details, etc.]


import SwiftUI

/// A view representing the detailed, full-screen view of a single card.
struct SingleCardView: View {
    /// The main content of the SingleCardView.
    var body: some View {
        Color.yellow // Sets the background color of the view to yellow. This is a placeholder; you'll likely replace this with more complex content.
    }
}

/// A preview provider for the SingleCardView, used in Xcode's canvas.
#Preview {
    SingleCardView()
}
