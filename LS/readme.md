[Learning Swift, 3rd Edition - Jonathon Manning, Paris Buttfield-Addison, Tim Nugent](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-swift-3rd/9781491987568/)

You’ll begin with Swift programming basics—including guidelines for making your code "Swifty"—and learn how to work with Xcode and its built-in Interface Builder. Then you’ll dive step-by-step into building and customizing a basic app for taking, editing, and deleting selfies. You’ll also tune and test the app for performance and manage the app’s presence in the App Store.

Divided into four parts, this book includes:

* Swift 4 basics: Learn Swift’s basic building blocks and the features of object-oriented development
* Building the Selfiegram app: Build model objects and the UI for your selfie app and add location support, user settings, and notifications
* Polishing Selfiegram: Create a theme and support for sharing and add custom views, image overlays, and localization
* Beyond app development: Debug and performance test with Xcode, automate chores with Fastlane, and user-test the app with TestFlight
