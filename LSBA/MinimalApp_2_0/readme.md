Contains the code used in the chapter entitled: Creating a Minimal Mobile App

We will get familiar with the basic organization of an iOS project. We will run it in a simulator, which will be our first friend through the development process. A Git version control system will be introduced, because it's part of Xcode. With it, through the development process, we can track our changes to the source code. Then, at some point, we can easily switch back to a specific version. We will learn how to keep our code under control and to jump to a specific version, developed earlier by us.
