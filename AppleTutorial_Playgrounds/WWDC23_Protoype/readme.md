[Prototype with Xcode Playgrounds](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10250/)

Speed up feature development by prototyping new code with Xcode Playgrounds, eliminating the need to keep rebuilding and relaunching your project to verify your changes. We'll show you how using a playground in your project or package can help you try out your code in various scenarios and take a close look at the returned values, including complex structures and user interface elements, so you can quickly iterate on a feature before integrating it into your project.
