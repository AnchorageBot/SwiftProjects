Module 1 Objectives
* Explain the concept of data flow in SwiftUI applications.
* Identify the stages of data flow in SwiftUI.

Module 1 Key Points and Main Takeaways:
* Data Flow in SwiftUI: Data flow is the movement of data through an app’s view hierarchy, which is essential for keeping the UI in sync with the data.
* Data Passing: You saw how data is passed from parent views to child views in SwiftUI, using initializer methods.
* Stages of Data Flow: You walked through the different stages of data flow, from defining the data and views, passing data from the app’s entry point and passing data down the view hierarchy to rendering the views on the screen.
