//
// BudgetTrackerApp.swift
//
// Abstract:
// A SwiftUI-based personal finance tracking application that manages and displays
// financial transactions. The app uses a simple data model to track income and expenses
// across different categories. This implementation provides the foundational structure
// for a budget management system with potential for expansion into a full-featured
// financial tracking solution.
//
// Architecture Overview:
// - Follows SwiftUI's declarative pattern
// - Uses MVVM architecture (though ViewModel not yet implemented)
// - Employs value types (structs) for data integrity
//

import SwiftUI

// MARK: - Data Model

/// Represents a single financial transaction in the budget tracking system
/// Uses value semantics to ensure data integrity and thread safety
struct FinancialEntry: Identifiable {
    /// Unique identifier for the entry, required by Identifiable protocol
    let id: UUID
    
    /// The monetary value of the transaction
    /// Positive values represent actual amounts for both income and expenses
    let amount: Double
    
    /// Classification of the transaction (e.g., "Groceries", "Income", "Technology")
    /// Used for grouping and analysis purposes
    let category: String
    
    /// Distinguishes between expenses (true) and income (false)
    /// This boolean flag helps in calculating net worth and budget analysis
    let isExpense: Bool
}

// MARK: - Application Entry Point

/// The main entry point for the budget tracking application
/// Conforms to the App protocol as required by SwiftUI lifecycle
@main
struct BudgetTrackerApp: App {
    /// Defines the root scene of the application
    /// WindowGroup is the primary container for the app's content
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
        }
    }
}

// MARK: - Primary View Layer

/// The root view of the application, responsible for displaying financial data
/// Currently contains sample data but could be extended to handle real transactions
struct ContentView: View {
    /// Sample financial entries for development and testing
    /// In a production app, this would likely be managed by a ViewModel
    /// and possibly stored in persistent storage
    let entries = [
        FinancialEntry(
            id: UUID(),
            amount: 3000,

            id: UUID(),
            amount: 10,
            category: "Subscription",
            isExpense: true
        )

    /// The view's body property, currently returns an empty view
    /// TODO: Implement actual UI components to display financial entries
    var body: some View {
