[Moss - Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moss)

Botanically, mosses are non-vascular plants in the land plant division Bryophyta. They are usually small (a few centimeters tall) herbaceous (non-woody) plants that absorb water and nutrients mainly through their leaves and harvest carbon dioxide and sunlight to create food by photosynthesis

Male and female fire moss, for example emit different and complex volatile organic scents
