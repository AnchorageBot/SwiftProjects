In Xcode, here are the key commands for highlighting and moving a block of code to the left:

To highlight/select code:
- Click and drag with your mouse
- Shift + Arrow keys to extend selection
- Command + A to select all content
- Option + Shift + Arrow keys to select by semantic units (like entire functions)

To move a block of code to the left (decrease indentation):
- Select the code block first, then press Shift + Tab

Other useful related shortcuts:
- Tab (after selecting code): Move code to the right (increase indentation)
- Command + [ : Decrease indentation (same as Shift + Tab)
- Command + ] : Increase indentation (same as Tab)
- Control + I: Re-indent selected code according to Xcode's formatting rules

These keyboard shortcuts should help you efficiently manage code indentation
