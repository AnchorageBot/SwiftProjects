Tardigrades, known colloquially as water bears or moss piglets, are a phylum of eight-legged segmented micro-animals.

Tardigrades are often found on lichens and mosses— for example, by soaking a piece of moss in water

Tardigrades are among the most resilient animals known, with individual species able to survive extreme conditions – such as exposure to extreme temperatures, extreme pressures (both high and low), air deprivation, radiation, dehydration, and starvation – that would quickly kill most other known forms of life. Tardigrades have survived exposure to outer space.
