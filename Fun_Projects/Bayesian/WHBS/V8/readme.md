Abstract:

This test suite validates the core functionality of the BayesCalculator
app, including probability calculations, data validation, and formatting
helpers. It ensures accurate Bayesian analysis calculations and proper
handling of edge cases.

BayesCalculatorTests.swift results:

* testRoomDataValidation(): Expectation failed: (negativeNoise.noise → -5.0) == (0 → 0.0)
Negative noise should be set to 0

* testRoomDataValidation(): Expectation failed: (negativeNoNoise.noNoise → -15.0) == (0 → 0.0)
Negative no-noise should be set to 0

* testEdgeCases(): Expectation failed: (calculator.results.priorB → 0.8823529411764706) == (0 → 0.0)
Prior should be 0 with no observations

* testEdgeCases(): Expectation failed: (calculator.results.likelihoodNB → 0.1) == (0 → 0.0)
Likelihood should be 0 with no observations

* testEdgeCases(): Expectation failed: (calculator.results.posteriorBN → 0.7500000000000001) == (0 → 0.0)
Posterior should be 0 with no observations

Abstract:

This test suite validates the user interface functionality of the BayesCalculator app
through automated UI testing. It verifies navigation flows, data input handling,
probability calculation updates, and accessibility features. The tests ensure
the app provides a reliable and user-friendly interface for Bayesian analysis.

BayesCalculatorUITests.swift results:

* testNavigationFlows(): XCTAssertTrue failed - About link should be visible

* testInputValidation(): XCTAssertTrue failed - Validation alert should appear for invalid input

* testAccessibilityLabels(): XCTAssertTrue failed - Room name field should be accessible

The main issues were:

* Improper handling of negative values in RoomData
  
* Incorrect expectations for zero observation cases
  
* UI element timing and visibility issues
  
* Missing or incorrect accessibility identifiers
