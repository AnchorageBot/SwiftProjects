Passing Tests:
- testRoomDataValidation()
- testEdgeCases()
- testNavigationFlows()
- testEditMode()

Failing Tests with their specific issues:
1. testAllNavigationFlows(): "How to Use This Calculator link should exist"
2. testSectionExpansion(): "Room data should be visible when expanded"
3. testLaunch(): "Section 'PRIOR PROBABILITIES' should exist"
4. testInitialState(): "Room name display should exist"

These failures appear to be related to:
- Element identification issues
- Timing/synchronization issues

- Possibly different element labels in the actual UI versus our test expectations
