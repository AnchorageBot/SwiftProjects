[Bayesian Probability - Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_probability)

Bayesian probability is an interpretation of the concept of probability, in which, instead of frequency or propensity of some 
phenomenon, probability is interpreted as reasonable expectation representing a state of knowledge or as quantification of a personal
belief.

The term Bayesian derives from the 18th-century mathematician and theologian Thomas Bayes, who provided the first mathematical
treatment of a non-trivial problem of statistical data analysis using what is now known as Bayesian inference. Mathematician 
Pierre-Simon Laplace pioneered and popularized what is now called Bayesian probability.

P(A|B) = P(B|A) Ã— P(A) / P(B)

* P(A|B) is the posterior probability
* P(B|A) is the likelihood
* P(A) is the prior probability
* P(B) is the evidence

Probability is a number between 0 and 1 (including both) that represents a degree of belief in a fact or prediction - Future events

*  [In common usage, the word "probability" is used to mean the chance that a particular event (or set of events) will occur expressed on a linear scale from 0 (impossibility) to 1 (certainty), also expressed as a percentage between 0 and 100%. - Wolfram Mathworld](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Probability.html)

Likelihood is the probability of the data under the hypothesis - Past events

* [Likelihood is the hypothetical probability that an event that has already occurred would yield a specific outcome. The concept differs from that of a probability in that a probability refers to the occurrence of future events, while a likelihood refers to past events with known outcomes. - Wolfram Mathworld](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Likelihood.html)
