## The Royal Game of Ur - Anthropic's AI Claude

The Royal Game of Ur is one of the oldest known board games in the world, with a fascinating history spanning thousands of years.

## Historical Background
- Originated in ancient Mesopotamia around 2600-2400 BCE
- Discovered by Sir Leonard Woolley during excavations of the Royal Cemetery at Ur (in modern-day Iraq) in the 1920s
- Multiple game boards were found, with the best preserved examples made of wood inlaid with shell, lapis lazuli, and red limestone
- The game remained popular for over 3,000 years across the Middle East
- A Babylonian tablet from 177-176 BCE describing the rules was decoded by British Museum curator Irving Finkel in the 1980s

## Game Rules
The game combines strategy and luck:

- Played by two players on a board with 20 squares arranged in an asymmetric pattern
- Each player has 7 game pieces they try to move from start to finish
- Movement is determined by rolling four tetrahedral dice (similar to four-sided pyramids)
- The dice have two marked corners, giving possible rolls of 0-4
- Players move their pieces according to their dice roll
- If a player lands on an opponent's piece on certain squares, they can capture it, sending it back to start
- Some squares are "rosettes" (flower patterns) which give special benefits:
  - Landing on a rosette gives the player an extra turn
  - Pieces on rosettes are safe from capture
- The first player to move all seven pieces off the board wins

The game represents a fascinating blend of luck and strategy that has entertained people across millennia and cultures, making it a remarkable artifact of human recreational history.
