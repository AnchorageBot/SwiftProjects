Diophantine equations are polynomial equations, usually with two or more unknowns, for which only integer solutions are sought. They are named after the 3rd-century Alexandrian mathematician Diophantus, who studied them extensively.

Our problem involves finding whole numbers of socks (you can't have half a sock!). When we express the probability condition algebraically, we arrive at an equation where we are looking for integer solutions for the number of red socks (R) and the total number of socks (T). This makes it a natural fit for using Diophantine equation techniques.
