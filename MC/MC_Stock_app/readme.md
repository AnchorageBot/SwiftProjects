To run the app:
* Launch Xcode on your Mac. If you don't have it installed, you can download it from the App Store.

* Create a new project:
  * Click "File" > "New" > "Project"
  * Choose "iOS" as the platform
  * Select "App" under the Application section
  * Click "Next"

* Configure the project:
  * Enter a name for your project (e.g., "MonteCarloStock")
  * Choose a location to save the project
  * Ensure "Interface" is set to "SwiftUI" and "Language" is set to "Swift"
  * Click "Create"

* Replace the default ContentView.swift:
  * In the Project Navigator (left sidebar), find and select the "ContentView.swift" file
  * Delete all the existing code in this file
  * Paste the entire script we created into this file

* Add the Charts framework:
  * Click on your project name in the Project Navigator
  * Select your target under the "TARGETS" section
  * Go to the "General" tab
  * Scroll down to "Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content"
  * Click the "+" button
  * Search for "Charts" and add it

* Update the main app file:
  * In the Project Navigator, find the file named "MonteCarloStockApp.swift"
  * Replace its content with the "MonteCarloPiApp.swift" in this respository

* Run the app:
  * Choose a simulator from the scheme menu in the top left corner of Xcode (e.g., "iPhone 15 Pro")
  * Click the "Run" button (play icon) or press Cmd+R

* Interact with the app:
  * Once the app launches in the simulator, you'll see the UI we designed
  * Click the "Run Simulation" button to perform the Monte Carlo estimation of pi
  * The graph will update, showing the randomly generated points and the estimated value of pi

Remember that this is an iOS app, so it's designed to run on iOS devices or simulators. If you want to run it as a macOS app instead, you'll need to create a macOS project and make some minor adjustments to the UI code to fit the macOS environment.
