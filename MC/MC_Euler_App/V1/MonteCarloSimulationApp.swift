// MonteCarloSimulationApp.swift

//
//  Created by ATS and Claude on 6/27/24
//  Made with Xcode 15.4
//

// Abstract:
// This is the main app file for the Monte Carlo Simulation app for estimating the mathematical constant e.
// It sets up the app structure and defines the main entry point.
// The app uses SwiftUI for its user interface and allows users to run simulations to estimate e.

import SwiftUI

@main
struct MonteCarloSimulationApp: App {
    var body: some Scene {
        // Define the main window group of the app
        WindowGroup {
            // Set ContentView as the root view of the app
            ContentView()
        }
    }
