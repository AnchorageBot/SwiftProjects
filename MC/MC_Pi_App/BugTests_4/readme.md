# Monte Carlo Pi Estimation App - Performance Testing Guide

This guide provides instructions on how to perform performance testing on the Monte Carlo Pi Estimation app using Instruments in Xcode.

## Preparing for Performance Testing

1. Ensure your app is built in Release configuration for accurate performance measurements.
2. Use a physical device for testing if possible, as simulators may not provide accurate performance metrics.

## Using Instruments for Performance Testing

### Launch Instruments

1. Open your project in Xcode.
2. Go to Product > Profile (or use the keyboard shortcut Cmd + I).
3. Xcode will build your app and open Instruments.

### Choose Profiling Templates

In Instruments, you'll see various profiling templates. For our performance testing, we'll focus on:

1. Time Profiler: For CPU usage analysis
2. Allocations: For memory usage and leak detection
3. Core Animation: For UI responsiveness

### Running Performance Tests

#### CPU Usage (Time Profiler)

1. Select the Time Profiler template.
2. Click the red record button to start profiling.
3. Interact with your app, focusing on the Monte Carlo simulation.
4. Click the stop button when done.
5. Analyze the results:
   - Look for functions consuming excessive CPU time
   - Pay attention to the "estimatePi" function and UI update methods

#### Memory Usage and Leaks (Allocations)

1. Select the Allocations template.
2. Click the record button to start profiling.
3. Interact with your app, running multiple simulations.
4. Click the stop button when done.
5. Analyze the results:
   - Check the "Memory Usage" graph for any unexpected spikes
   - Look for any persistent memory growth indicating potential leaks
   - Examine the "Allocation Summary" for any unusually large allocations

#### UI Responsiveness (Core Animation)

1. Select the Core Animation template.
2. Click the record button to start profiling.
3. Interact with your app, focusing on UI transitions and updates during simulation.
4. Click the stop button when done.
5. Analyze the results:
   - Look at the "FPS" (Frames Per Second) graph
   - Check for any drops below 60 FPS, indicating UI lag
   - Examine the "GPU Driver" usage for any spikes during UI updates

## Interpreting Results and Taking Action

### CPU Usage

- If the "estimatePi" function is consuming excessive CPU time:
  1. Consider optimizing the algorithm
  2. Look for any unnecessary computations or loop inefficiencies

- If UI-related methods are heavy:
  1. Reduce complexity of UI updates
  2. Consider moving heavy computations to background threads

### Memory Usage

- If memory usage grows continuously:
  1. Check for retain cycles in your SwiftUI views
  2. Ensure large data structures (like the points array) are being properly managed

- For any detected leaks:
  1. Examine the leak traces provided by Instruments
  2. Fix retain cycles or missing deallocations

### UI Responsiveness

- If FPS drops during simulations:
  1. Ensure heavy computations are not blocking the main thread
  2. Consider using background threads for the Monte Carlo simulation

- If GPU usage is high:
  1. Simplify complex UI elements
  2. Reduce the frequency of UI updates during simulation

## General Performance Optimization Tips

1. Use `@State` and `@Binding` judiciously to prevent unnecessary view redraws
2. Consider using `AsyncImage` for loading and caching the circle overlay
3. Implement pagination or lazy loading if dealing with large datasets
4. Use `DispatchQueue.global().async` for running the Monte Carlo simulation off the main thread

Remember, performance optimization is an iterative process. Make changes, re-run the performance tests, and compare results to see improvements.
