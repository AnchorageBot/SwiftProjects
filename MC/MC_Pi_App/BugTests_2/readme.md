* Use XCUITest for automated UI testing
* Create test cases that simulate user interactions
* Test different device sizes and orientations

# Monte Carlo Pi Estimation App - UI Testing Guide

This guide provides instructions on how to add and run UI tests for the Monte Carlo Pi Estimation app using XCUITest in Xcode.

## Adding UI Tests to Your Xcode Project

1. Open your Xcode project for the Monte Carlo Pi Estimation app.

2. Go to File > New > Target.

3. In the new target window, select "UI Testing Bundle" under the iOS tab.

4. Click "Next" and name your test target (e.g., "MonteCarloPiUITests").

5. Click "Finish" to create the new UI test target.

6. Xcode will generate a new file named `MonteCarloPiUITests.swift` (or similar, based on your project name).

7. Replace the contents of this file with the provided UI test code.

8. Ensure the app target is selected as the target application for the UI tests:
   - Select the UI test target in the project navigator
   - In the General tab, under "Target Application", select your main app target

## Running the UI Tests

1. To run all UI tests:
   - Use the keyboard shortcut `Cmd + U`
   - Or go to Product > Test in the Xcode menu

2. To run a specific UI test:
   - Click the diamond-shaped icon next to the test function you want to run

3. To run tests in a specific file:
   - Right-click on the file in the project navigator
   - Select "Run 'TestFileName'" from the context menu

4. Xcode will build the app, launch the simulator, and run the tests automatically.

## Testing on Different Devices and Orientations

1. To test on different device sizes:
   - Select different simulators from the device menu in Xcode
   - Run the tests on each selected device

2. To test different orientations:
   - The `testDifferentOrientations()` function in the provided tests will automatically check portrait and landscape orientations

## Interpreting Test Results

- Green checkmark: The test passed
- Red X: The test failed
- Gray diamond: The test didn't run

## Acting on Test Results

1. If all tests pass:
   - Your UI implementation is working as expected
   - The app is responsive to different device sizes and orientations

2. If a test fails:
   - Xcode will show you which assertion failed
   - Review the error message and the line of code where the failure occurred
   - Use the test failure snapshot to visually inspect the UI state at the point of failure

3. Common issues to look out for:
   - UI elements not appearing where expected
   - Buttons or controls not being responsive
   - Text or images not displaying correctly
   - Issues with different device sizes or orientations

4. Iterative process:
   - Fix any issues in your UI implementation
   - Re-run the tests
   - Repeat until all tests pass

## Maintaining and Updating UI Tests

- As you add new features or modify existing UI elements, update your UI tests accordingly
- Regularly run your UI test suite to catch any regressions
- Consider adding new tests for new UI flows or edge cases

Remember, thorough UI testing helps ensure a consistent and reliable user experience across different devices and scenarios. Happy testing!
