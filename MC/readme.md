[Monte Carlo method - wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method)

Monte Carlo methods, or Monte Carlo experiments, are a broad class of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results.
The underlying concept is to use randomness to solve problems that might be deterministic in principle. The name comes from the Monte Carlo Casino in Monaco,
where the primary developer of the method, physicist Stanislaw Ulam, was inspired by his uncle's gambling habits.

Monte Carlo methods are mainly used in three distinct problem classes: optimization, numerical integration, and generating draws from a probability distribution.
They can also be used to model phenomena with significant uncertainty in inputs, such as calculating the risk of a nuclear power plant failure. Monte Carlo methods
are often implemented using computer simulations, and they can provide approximate solutions to problems that are otherwise intractable or too complex to analyze mathematically.

Running the Swift Scripts on Xcode 15.4 (Mac):
* Open Xcode on your Mac.
* Create a new playground by selecting "File" -> "New" -> "Playground" from the menu bar.
* Choose a name for your playground, select the platform as "macOS", and choose the "Blank" template. Then click "Next".
* Choose a location to save your playground and click "Create".
* Replace the default code in the playground with the Swift script you want to run.
* To execute the script, click the "Run" button in the bottom-left corner of the playground editor or press "Shift+Command+Enter".
* The output will be displayed in the console area on the right side of the playground editor.

Running the Swift Scripts on Swift Playgrounds 4.5.1 (iPad):
* Open the Swift Playgrounds app on your iPad.
* Tap the "+" button in the top-left corner to create a new playground.
* Choose the "Blank" template and tap "Next".
* Give your playground a name and tap "Create".
* Replace the default code in the playground with the Swift script you want to run.
* To execute the script, tap the "Run My Code" button in the bottom-right corner of the screen.
* The output will be displayed in the console area at the bottom of the screen.
