How to bug test an app

- - - -

1. Unit Testing:
   - Use XCTest framework to write unit tests
   - Test individual components and functions in isolation
   - Aim for high code coverage

2. UI Testing:
   - Use XCUITest for automated UI testing
   - Create test cases that simulate user interactions
   - Test different device sizes and orientations

3. Integration Testing:
   - Test how different modules of your app work together
   - Ensure data flows correctly between components

4. Performance Testing:
   - Use Instruments in Xcode to profile your app
   - Check for memory leaks, CPU usage, and responsiveness

5. Accessibility Testing:
   - Ensure your app works well with VoiceOver and other accessibility features

6. Network Testing:
   - Test your app's behavior with various network conditions
   - Use tools like Charles Proxy to simulate different scenarios

7. Localization Testing:
   - Test your app in different languages and regions

8. Beta Testing:
   - Use TestFlight to distribute your app to beta testers
   - Gather feedback and crash reports

9. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):
   - Set up automated testing pipelines (e.g., using fastlane)
   - Run tests automatically on each commit

10. Code Review:
    - Implement a thorough code review process
    - Use static analysis tools like SwiftLint
