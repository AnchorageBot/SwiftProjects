Open AI's mission is to ensure that artificial general intelligence—AI systems that are generally smarter than humans—benefits all of humanity.

Open AI has trained a model called ChatGPT which interacts in a conversational way. The dialogue format makes it possible for ChatGPT to answer followup questions, admit its mistakes, challenge incorrect premises, and reject inappropriate requests.
