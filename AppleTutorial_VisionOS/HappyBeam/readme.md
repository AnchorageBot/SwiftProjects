Overview

In visionOS, you can create fun, dynamic games and apps using several different frameworks to create new kinds of spatial experiences: RealityKit, ARKit, SwiftUI, and Group Activities. This sample introduces Happy Beam, a game where you and your friends can hop on a FaceTime call and play together.

Youâ€™ll learn the mechanics of the game where grumpy clouds float around in the space, and people play by making a heart shape with their hands to project a beam. People aim the beam at the clouds to cheer them up, and a score counter keeps track of how well each player does cheering up the clouds.
