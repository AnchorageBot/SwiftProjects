* [@Bindable](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/bindable)
  * Use this property wrapper to create bindings to mutable properties of a data model object that conforms to the Observable protocol. 
* [@Binding](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/binding)
  * Use a binding to create a two-way connection between a property that stores data, and a view that displays and changes the data. A binding connects a property to a source of truth stored elsewhere, instead of storing data directly.
* [@Environment](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/environment)
  * Use the Environment property wrapper to read a value stored in a viewâ€™s environment.
* [@State](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/state)
  * Use state as the single source of truth for a given value type that you store in a view hierarchy. Create a state value in an App, Scene, or View by applying the @State attribute to a property declaration and providing an initial value.
* [Observable](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Observation/Observable)
  * A type that emits notifications to observers when underlying data changes. Conforming to this protocol signals to other APIs that the type supports observation.
