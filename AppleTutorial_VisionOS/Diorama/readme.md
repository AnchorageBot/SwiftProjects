Overview

Use Reality Composer Pro to compose, edit, and preview RealityKit content for your visionOS app. In your Reality Composer Pro project, you can create one or more scenes, each of which contains a hierarchy of virtual objects called entities that your app can efficiently load and display.

In addition to helping you compose entity hierarchies, Reality Composer Pro also gives you the ability to add and configure components — even custom components that you’ve written — to the entities in your scenes.
