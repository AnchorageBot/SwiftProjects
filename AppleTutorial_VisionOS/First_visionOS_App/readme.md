Create your Xcode project

Create a new project in Xcode by choosing File > New > Project. Navigate to the visionOS section of the template chooser, and choose the App template. When prompted, specify a name for your project along with other options.

When creating a new visionOS app, you can configure your app’s initial scene types from the configuration dialog. To display primarily 2D content in your initial scene, choose a Window as your initial scene type. For primarily 3D content, choose a Volume. You can also add an immersive scene to place your content in the person’s surroundings.
