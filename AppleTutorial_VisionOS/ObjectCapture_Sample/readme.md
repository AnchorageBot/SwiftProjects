[Meet Object Capture for iOS - WWDC23 Video](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10191/)

Discover how you can offer an end-to-end Object Capture experience directly in your iOS apps to help people turn their objects into ready-to-use 3D models. Learn how you can create a fully automated Object Capture scan flow with our sample app and how you can assist people in automatically capturing the best content for their model. We'll also discuss LiDAR data and provide best practices for scanning objects.
