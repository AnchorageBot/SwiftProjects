Equations:

* [1D Heat Equation - wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_equation)
  * As the prototypical parabolic partial differential equation, the heat equation is among the most widely studied topics in pure mathematics, and its analysis is regarded as fundamental to the broader field of partial differential equations. The heat equation can also be considered on Riemannian manifolds, leading to many geometric applications.  

* [Burgers Equation - wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burgers%27_equation)
  * Burgers' equation or Bateman–Burgers equation is a fundamental partial differential equation and convection–diffusion equation occurring in various areas of applied mathematics, such as fluid mechanics, nonlinear acoustics, gas dynamics, and traffic flow.

Additional background:

* [Boundary value problem - wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_value_problem)
  * In the study of differential equations, a boundary-value problem is a differential equation subjected to constraints called boundary conditions. A solution to a boundary value problem is a solution to the differential equation which also satisfies the boundary conditions.
 
* [Discretization - wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discretization)
   * In applied mathematics, discretization is the process of transferring continuous    functions, models, variables, and equations into discrete counterparts. 

* [Finite difference - wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference)
  * A finite difference is a mathematical expression of the form f (x + b) − f (x + a). If a finite difference is divided by b − a, one gets a difference quotient. The approximation of derivatives by finite differences plays a central role in finite difference methods for the numerical solution of differential equations, especially boundary value problems.
  * Three basic types are commonly considered: forward, backward, and central finite differences.
  * Finite differences were introduced by Brook Taylor in 1715 and have also been studied as abstract self-standing mathematical objects in works by George Boole (1860), L. M. Milne-Thomson (1933), and Károly Jordan (1939). Finite differences trace their origins back to one of Jost Bürgi's algorithms (c. 1592) and work by others including Isaac Newton. The formal calculus of finite differences can be viewed as an alternative to the calculus of infinitesimals.
