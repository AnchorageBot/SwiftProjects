Section 1

Create a list

List is a common SwiftUI container view that displays data in a single column. Unlike stacks, lists scroll vertically, 
so you don’t need to worry about having more data than will fit on the screen. This makes lists ideal when
you don’t know the length of a data set or when the length can change.
