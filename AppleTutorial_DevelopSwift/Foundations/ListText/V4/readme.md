Section 4

Use a toggle to customize behavior

Give people the option to remove names after they’re picked. To implement this feature, add a Toggle for people to choose between the two behaviors.

Toggles represent an on/off state. Much like the text field, your toggle will modify the state of your view, so you’ll need to add a new @State property.
