RGB Settings for Gradients in Assets:

* gardenGreen: RGB(141, 182, 0)
* skyBlue: RGB(135, 206, 235)
* leafGreen: RGB(76, 187, 23)
* sunYellow: RGB(255, 204, 0)

To apply these colors, go to the Assets.xcassets folder in Xcode, create new color sets with the corresponding names (gardenGreen, skyBlue, leafGreen, sunYellow), and set their RGB values as provided above.

The refactored scripts now have a nature theme reminiscent of a garden. The color scheme includes shades of green, blue, and yellow to create a fresh and vibrant look. The icons and text have been updated to reflect the garden theme as well.

Remember to update the color sets in the Assets.xcassets folder with the provided RGB values to ensure the colors are applied correctly.

In this case, you should keep the AccentColor and AppIcon color sets in your Assets.xcassets folder, as they serve specific purposes in your app:

* AccentColor: This color set is used by the system to automatically color certain UI elements, such as buttons, navigation bars, and tab bars. It helps maintain a consistent look and feel throughout your app.
* AppIcon: This color set is used to define the colors used in your app's icon. It is not directly related to the colors used within your app's user interface.
* 
However, you should remove the GradientBottom and GradientTop color sets since they are no longer needed in the refactored code. Instead, you will be adding the new color sets (gardenGreen, skyBlue, leafGreen, and sunYellow) to define the colors for your app's new nature-themed gradient and UI elements.

Here's what you should do:
* Open your Assets.xcassets folder in Xcode.
* Locate the GradientBottom and GradientTop color sets.
* Select each of these color sets and press the Delete key to remove them.
* Right-click on the empty space within the Assets.xcassets folder and choose "New Color Set" to create a new color set for each of the following: gardenGreen, skyBlue, leafGreen, and sunYellow.
* For each new color set, click on the "Color" field in the Attributes Inspector (on the right side of the Xcode window) and enter the corresponding RGB values provided in the previous response.
* 
By following these steps, you will remove the unnecessary color sets and add the new ones required for the refactored code with the nature theme.

Remember to keep the AccentColor and AppIcon color sets intact, as they have specific roles in your app's overall appearance.
