RGB Settings for Gradients in Assets:

gardenGreen: RGB(141, 182, 0)
skyBlue: RGB(135, 206, 235)
leafGreen: RGB(76, 187, 23)
sunYellow: RGB(255, 204, 0)

To apply these colors, go to the Assets.xcassets folder in Xcode, create new color sets with the corresponding names (gardenGreen, skyBlue, leafGreen, sunYellow), and set their RGB values as provided above.

The refactored scripts now have a nature theme reminiscent of a garden. The color scheme includes shades of green, blue, and yellow to create a fresh and vibrant look. The icons and text have been updated to reflect the garden theme as well.

Remember to update the color sets in the Assets.xcassets folder with the provided RGB values to ensure the colors are applied correctly.
