SwiftData is a framework introduced by Apple that provides a simplified and efficient way to manage and persist data in your SwiftUI applications. It seamlessly integrates with SwiftUI views and offers a declarative approach to data management.

Here's a brief explanation of how SwiftData works and where the data entered into the app is stored:

1. Data Model:
   - In SwiftData, you define your data models using Swift classes or structures.
   - These models represent the entities or objects that your app works with, such as the `Friend` model in the Birthdays app.
   - SwiftData uses the `@Model` property wrapper to mark a class or structure as a data model, enabling SwiftData to manage and persist instances of that model.

2. Model Context:
   - SwiftData introduces the concept of a "model context" (`ModelContext`), which acts as a container for your data models.
   - The model context is responsible for managing the lifecycle of your data, including fetching, saving, and deleting model instances.
   - In your SwiftUI views, you access the model context using the `@Environment(\.modelContext)` property wrapper, which provides a reference to the current model context.

3. Data Persistence:
   - By default, SwiftData automatically persists the data entered into the app on the device's local storage.
   - When you create a new instance of a data model (e.g., `Friend`) and insert it into the model context using `context.insert()`, SwiftData saves that instance to the persistent store.
   - The persistent store is typically a SQLite database that SwiftData manages behind the scenes.
   - SwiftData handles the persistence operations efficiently, ensuring that your data is saved and retrieved as needed.

4. Data Retrieval:
   - To retrieve data from the persistent store, you use the `@Query` property wrapper in your SwiftUI views.
   - `@Query` allows you to fetch instances of a specific data model based on certain criteria or filters.
   - SwiftData automatically updates the `@Query` results whenever the underlying data changes, ensuring that your views always reflect the latest data.

5. Data Deletion:
   - To delete data from the persistent store, you use the `context.delete()` method, passing the instance of the data model you want to delete.
   - SwiftData removes the specified instance from the persistent store and updates any related `@Query` results accordingly.

Under the hood, SwiftData uses Core Data, which is a powerful framework provided by Apple for managing object graphs and persisting data. However, SwiftData abstracts away many of the complexities of Core Data and provides a more streamlined and intuitive API for working with data in SwiftUI apps.

By leveraging SwiftData, you can easily manage and persist data in your app without worrying about the low-level details of data storage and retrieval. SwiftData takes care of efficiently storing the data on the device's local storage and provides a convenient way to access and manipulate that data through the model context and property wrappers like `@Model` and `@Query`.

It's important to note that the data entered into the app using SwiftData is stored locally on the device and is specific to that particular installation of the app. If the app is uninstalled or the device is wiped, the data will be lost unless it is explicitly backed up or synchronized with a remote server.
