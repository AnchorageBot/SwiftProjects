Section 4

Convert your structure to a SwiftData model

An app to help you remember birthdays isn’t much use if it doesn’t store the data you enter. You’ll use the SwiftData framework to create and store instances of Friend so they are still there when the app is relaunched.

Section 5

Connect SwiftData and SwiftUI 

Learn to power SwiftUI with a SwiftData model by upgrading the @State array to SwiftData queries and operations.
Birthdays won’t build until you complete all the steps in this section, so don’t get discouraged when you see errors as you work through the steps. You’ll need to set up a container, change your @State array to use SwiftData, and then save new friends correctly before you see the app working again.
