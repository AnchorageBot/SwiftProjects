Section 8

Adapt the detail view to different presentation contexts

You present MovieDetail in two ways:
* In a sheet when adding a new movie
* In a navigation stack when editing a movie

In a sheet, the detail view should present the Done and Cancel buttons. But on a navigation stack, it should just let you dismiss with the built-in Back button and the swipe-to-dismiss gesture.

In this section, you’ll remove the clutter from the navigation experience, adapting it to both contexts it’s displayed in.
