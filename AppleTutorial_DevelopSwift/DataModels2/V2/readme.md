Section 2

Create a Movie model

In this app, youâ€™ll keep track of a list of movies. Start by creating the data model to represent the movies people will track.

Rather than deleting the Item file provided by the template and making a new Movie file, you can rename the existing type and let Xcode handle some of the work for you.
