Section 7

Use the toolbar to add actions

Dragging isn’t the ideal way to dismiss a sheet for editing a new item. It’s not clear how to add the item when you’re done editing, and there’s no way to cancel.

Sheets and other modal interfaces usually have explicit controls to exit them. For example, before deleting an item, an app might display an alert with buttons labeled Delete and Cancel. For a sheet, you present such controls in a navigation bar.
