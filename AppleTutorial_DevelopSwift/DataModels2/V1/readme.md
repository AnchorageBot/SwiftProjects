Section 1

Create the project

Start by creating a new project. Because the following chapter adds data about friends, youâ€™ll include them in the title of the app.

The SwiftData app template gives you a head start by including an interface for creating and deleting items in the data store.

To create the project in Xcode 15.3
* File -> New -> Project
* Template -> iOS -> Application -> App
* Project Name -> FavoriteMovies
* Interface -> SwiftUI
* Language -> Swift
* Storage -> SwiftData

This autogenerates three files
* FavoriteMoviesApp.swift
* ContentView.swift
* Item.swift
