Apple Core ML

* Core ML is optimized for on-device performance of a broad variety of model 
    types by leveraging Apple hardware and minimizing memory footprint and power consumption.

* [Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml)

* Typical workflow - on device
  * Add a model to the project
  * Load the model file in the app
  * User inputs required data
  * User receives prediction output
    
* A model is the result of applying a machine learning algorithm to a set of training data.
